            >Since the inception of “Modern Trends in Molecular Magnetism (MTMM)” at IIT
Bombay in 2016, this international conference has evolved into a flagship biennial
conclave of internationally acclaimed researchers, academicians, and industry
experts to discuss recent advances, emerging trends, and future directions in the
field of molecular magnetism. Subsequent editions of MTMM were successfully
organized at IISER Bhopal (2019), IIT Kharagpur (2022) and IISc Bangalore (2024).
The Department of Chemical Sciences, Tezpur University, Assam will be organizing
the 5<sup>th</sup> edition of Modern Trends in Molecular Magnetism (MTMM) from 2-5
December 2026. The present edition of the conference will feature Keynote
Lectures, Invited Lectures, Oral Presentations, Poster Presentations and will provide
a vibrant platform for sharing cutting-edge research, fostering interdisciplinary
dialogue and building meaningful collaborations that advance scientific inquiry and
global knowledge exchange in emerging aspects of molecular magnetism.</p>
